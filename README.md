# Algorithms-Class-Assignments
Coding done for CS315, Spring 2019

Each folder contains the final deliverables for one of
the five coding assignments for CS315, a rigorous
introduction to algorithms and data structures at UK.

I primarily used C for these assignments; I chose C
because I am comfortable with it and because it presents
less object-oriented overhead than the other options we
were given, Java and C++. It was thus easier to do these
low-level from-scratch assignments in C. For assignment
2, however, I used C++ because it made sense to implement
the assignment (ternary trees) as a C++ template object
for future refinement and potential use.

TOPICS
Project 1: Implementing linked lists, specifically a modified queue
Project 2: Ternary trees (like binary search trees, but with three branches a node)
Project 3: Word processing and hashing
Project 4: Graph structures and searches
Project 5: Markov algorithms
