The Famigram
by David Gallivan

This project conforms to the specs of assignment 4
 of CS315, spring 2019, at the Univesity of Kentucky.
 The program, famigram, will take commands to insert
 family graph data, check it for consistency, and
 search for relationships among individuals.


All commands must be formatted exactly right,
 as specified in aforementioned assignment
Any line in the data that does not begin with a
 designated command word will be treated as a
 comment and will not be processed. My test data,
 myfam.txt, has many such comments.

I have included in this archive the results of the
 following unix shell commands:

make run < data.family.txt > results.family.txt
./famigram < myfam.txt > myresults.txt
