CS315 Assignment 1: SecSim
By David Gallivan

THE PROGRAM:
"SecSim," short for "Secretary Simulation," simulates the activity of
a customer-service secretary answering clients' questions on the phone
and in person. The clients come in fast and furious for ~10 seconds,
and our dear secretary, Gary, works faster than a cyclone to answer as
many of them as possible. He works according to the specifications at:

www.cs.uky.edu/~raphael/courses/CS315/asg.secretary.html

To compile and run SecSim, simply type "make run" and watch Gary do
his stuff.

EXTRA CREDIT PURSUED:
Ideas 1 and 2 (see above URL) are implemented in SecSim-EC. "make ec"
will compile and run this version, which reports both the numbers of
callers vs. in-person visitors and a randomized time penalty for Gary's
being "flustered" when he finishes answering a phone call.

FINE-TUNED VERSION:
The so-called "fine-tuned" version is the same as the EC version, but
the constants q, p, d, and penalty (see above URL) have been adjusted
to simulate a better day at the office, where in-person visitors
actually stand a chance of getting their questions answered.

OTHER DETAILS:
-Gary is a hard worker who always stays a fraction of a second late to
round out the day's work, thus the simulation ends a smidge after the
10 second mark.
-Each visitor or caller has "priority" stored among her data; this is so
that extra credit idea 3 could be pursued more easily in the future.
