TTT: Ternary Tree conTraption

Welcome to the TTT, a C++ class that uses ternary trees to store numerical values.
For details on the requirements for the TTT, see the following URL:
www.cs.uky.edu/~raphael/courses/CS315/asg.ternary.html

The TTT itself (ttt.h, ttt.cpp, whence ttt.o) is the data type that I have used to implement the ternary tree.
In the code, TTT refers to such a tree, or to a node thereof. The ternary tree and its methods are entirely recursive, so every child node of a TTT is also a TTT.

usettt.cpp is the code for a demo program that includes and uses the TTT according to the specs at the above URL.
By default, the demo reads 1000 integers from standard input, sorts them into a ternary tree, and prints the tree to standard output.
One option integer command line argument, if entered, will change the number of integers read into the TTT.

To compile and run this demo on the standard data set given for the assignment:
make run < data.ternary.txt > output.file.txt
The results of this are stored in the included file results.terary.txt

To run it again, using the example data seen at the above URL:
./tttdemo 20 < 20data.txt > another.ouput.file.txt
The results of this are stored in the included file 20results.txt

Integers can also be entered via command line, but this is tedious unless the number of integers read in is small.

DEVELOPMENT NOTE
A C++ template class was used with a view towards developing the TTT further into a fully useable class for any numerical data type.
Currently, it only works reliably for integers; however, places have been indicated in the code by comments where a few adjustments would make
the TTT a viable way to store floats, longs, etc.

The class structure and the functions were also designed with a view to expanding the TTT for future applications like searching and sorting.
