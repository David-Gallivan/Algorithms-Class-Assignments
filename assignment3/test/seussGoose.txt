A moose is asleep. He is dreaming of moose drinks.
A goose is asleep. He is dreaming of goose drinks.
Now, all's well and good when a moose dreams of moose juice,
And nothing goes wrong when a goose dreams of goose juice.
The trouble comes on when a moose and a goose
Start dreaming they're drinking the other one's juice.
Moose juice, not goose juice, is juice for a moose;
And goose juice, not moose juice, is juice for a goose.

SO...
When moose gets a mouthful of juices of gooses
And moose gets a mouthful of juices of gooses
They always fall out of their beds screaming screams.

So I'm warning you now.
						Never drink in your dreams!
