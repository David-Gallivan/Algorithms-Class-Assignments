Welcome to the Oaxaca Wordcounter!

This program corresponds to the specifications at:
www.cs.uky.edu/~raphael/courses/CS315/asg.hashing.html
Specifically, the program reads in text from standard input,
stopping at EOF. It counts the occurrences of each word. It
prints the results twice - once in alphabetical order and once
in reverse numerical order - to standard output.

NOTE: These two outputs are separated by a blank line.

A hash table with external chaining and heap sort are used as specified.

Three input files are included along with files showing the corresponding outputs.

To compile and run:
make run < filename

After the first time:
./ow < filename
